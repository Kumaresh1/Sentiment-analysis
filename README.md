# Sentiment and Emotion Detection

This project implements a sentiment and emotion detection system using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), React, and Flask. The system provides an intuitive user interface for inputting text and obtaining sentiment and emotion analysis results.



## About

Sentiment and emotion detection is a task of analyzing the sentiment and emotional tone expressed in a given text. This project leverages the power of LSTM and BERT models to perform sentiment and emotion analysis on user-provided texts.

The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. It has been trained on a sentiment analysis dataset to predict the sentiment of a given text as positive, negative, or neutral.

BERT, on the other hand, is a pre-trained transformer model that excels at understanding the contextual meaning of words and sentences. It has been fine-tuned on an emotion analysis dataset to predict the emotion associated with a given text.

The frontend of the system is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to enter text and receive sentiment and emotion analysis results.

The backend of the system is implemented using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. It serves as the server-side component responsible for handling incoming requests from the frontend, processing the text, and invoking the LSTM and BERT models for sentiment and emotion analysis.
